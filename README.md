# The Island of Sepris, a DnD 5th Edition Puzzle Dungeon

## About
The Island of Sepris is a homebrew one-shot crafted by myself. While the plot is not mentioned here, this repo contains the base code for manipulating the dungeon.

## Dungeon Layout

The dungeon is laid out as a 3x3 grid with one empty space and behaves as a slider puzzle. Each room can be fully customized
